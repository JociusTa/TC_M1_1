##Context
    You are a newly hired developer in a company creating board games. 
    Your company needs to rewrite its old engine for rolling the dice.
    At first, this seems like a very simple task, but after the product manager
    gives you a list of requirements, you understand why this is not just a five-minute task.
##Requirements
    *Your solution should support from 1 to 5 dice.
    *The dice can have from 1 to 100 sides.
    *The solution should be able to simulate throwing the dice one or more times, returning the values of the dice.
    *The solution needs to store the information about the last 100 throws.
    *Document your code (using Python docstrings) and your overall solution (in a README file).
    *Provide suggestions about how your solution can be improved.
##Evaluation criteria
    *Adherence to the requirements. How well did you meet the requirements?
    *Code quality. Was your code well-structured? Did you use the correct levels of abstraction? Did you remove commented-out and unused code? Did you adhere to the PEP8?
    *Code performance. Did you use suitable algorithms and data structures to solve the problems?
##Bonus challenges
    *Write unit tests for code.
    *Create a web API for your module.
    *Expand your solution to support weighted dice.
##Additional questions 
    *What is Object-Oriented Programming? Select and explain two examples where using OOP concepts can improve the quality and usability of code.
    *What is Clean Code? Select four main key concepts and explain them using real-world examples.
    *Why do we need to document code? How can you do it? What should be provided inside the documentation?
    *addaWhy do we test code?
